# Hangman-Terminal-Game
Welcome to the Hangman Terminal Game repository! This is a simple command-line based Hangman game that you can play directly in your terminal without any graphical interface. Challenge your word-guessing skills and have fun!

How to Play:

1.) The game will randomly select a word from the given text file, and you have to guess it one letter at a time.

2.) Type a letter and press Enter.

3.) If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you'll lose a life.

4.) Keep guessing until you either guess the word or run out of lives.

5.) Have fun and challenge yourself to guess the word with the fewest attempts!

Restrictions:
The words only contain lowercase letters. If you try to guess anything else, it will be considered an attempt and you will lose a guess.


Feel free to customize the game to suit your preferences.
